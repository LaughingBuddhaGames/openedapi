Jobs at OpenEd
===============

Use of educational videos and games are changing the face of K-12 education.  But (prior to OpenEd) it has been difficult to 
impossible to find the right resource for any given topic or standard.   At the same time, 45 of 50 states are moving to a new
set of curriculum and educational standards called the Common Core State Standards.  As a result demand for aligned resources
to the Common Core is huge - and OpenEd is the only site that provides that in significant volume covering all the standards. 

OpenEd (www.opened.io) has the world's largest educational resource catalog - over a quarter million educational videos and games, 
all aligned to Common Core and other educational standards.   OpenEd lets teachers find the right resource for any given topic 
or standard.  It also allows teachers to build courses in its free Learning Management System- with the recommendation engine
finding the best content for anything the teacher is covering.  All of OpenEd is available via an [open API] 
(http://github.com/openedinc/openedapi), and most of OpenEd (everything but the recommendation engine) is available [open source]
(http://github.com/openedinc/opened.io).  

If you are a developer with a passion for making a difference in education with a commitment to open source and modern
approaches we want to hear from you.  

We are looking for strong Ruby backend developers with deep knowledge in database and full-text retrieval at massive knowledge.  
Background with web crawlers and harvesters and the semantic web is helpful.   Experience with machine learning techniques, neural
networks and genetic algorithms is a strong plus.   A track record with open source and crafting APIs is also very useful.
 
We are an early stage startup founded by several successful Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and technologists with a long track 
record of success.  We are a team of a dozen computer scientists and educators, but still have ample opportunity for
significant equity participation.   The successful candidate will get to work on some of the most interesting and advanced
projects we have: our recommendation engine and our "semantic harvester". Send resumes with links to other open source projects 
and why you think you would be a good candidate to jobs@opened.io
