[OpenEd](http://opened.io) is the world’s largest K-12 educational resource catalog, with over a million Common Core-aligned videos, games and assessments. While it integrates with all popular Learning Management Systems it offers its own simple “flipped classroom” LMS oriented to using resources.    It is the only site focused on offering Common Core and other standard aligned resources, so it has many more Common Core resources than any other catalog.

OpenEd uses a machine-learning based recommendation engine to align resources to standards.  OpenEd also uses subject matter experts in both K-12 knowledge domains and the Common Core to validate those alignments.  The approach of combining software and expert curation to produce accurate alignments in volume is unique in the industry.  

The OpenEd recommendation engine also suggests appropriate resources to teachers for their students and 
their courses.  OpenEd's recommendation engine improves over time based on student performance, teacher 
usage and aggregate student performance on resources world-wide.  

OpenEd also [offers an API](http://docs.opened.apiary.io) to other ed tech developers: both to find resources in our catalog and to contribute resources. In a short time it has been adopted by many ed tech companies, driving more users to our site.  It also insures that the site will keep lead as the largest K-12 resource catalog. The frontend of the www.opened.io site is itself [open source](http://github.com/openedinc/opened.io), as a demonstration of use of our API.
 
OpenEd has the following revenue streams:
* API usage - beyond a rate limited level of usage use of API is charged
* revenue share on paid content, i.e. an “app store model”
* analytics on student mastery of topics and standards, charged to teachers and parents (coming soon)

OpenEd's mission is to provide the comprehensive set of resources and services for flipped learning tied to the Common Core and other standards.  More capabilities focused on this mission will be appearing early in 2014.
