# Opened Partner API

OpenEd is the world's largest educational resource catalog, with over a million videos, games, assessments, homework, and lesson plans. It is the only site completely focused on aligning educational resources to standards.

The **OpenEd Partner API** lets you use the capabilities of the OpenEd engine to find resources and provide information about educational standards (Common Core and otherwise) inside your own apps and websites.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the https://partner.opened.com host. All data is sent and received as JSON.

All API calls require an OpenEd Access Token. Please write to us at api@opened.com to receive a Client ID and Secret which will allow you to generate an Access Token.

# Group Standards

OpenEd also allows you to search for information on the standards themselves (in addition to finding resources for standards).
Standards are organized into "standard groups" such as "Common Core Math" and "Common Core Language Arts".
Within a standard group there are "grade groups" such as "Elementary" and "Middle School".
Each grade group has a set of "categories" (sometimes known as "strands"), such as "Geometry".
Within categories there are individual standards. This method of organizing standards was created by the Common Core State Standards,
but we use it to structure all standard groups.

## Standard Groups [/1/standard_groups.json]
To navigate the standards hierarchies you first need to get the list of standard groups.
