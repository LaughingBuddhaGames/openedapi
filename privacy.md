## Date of Last Revision: 1/05/2014
OpenEd Inc.

This Privacy Policy applies to the Service, any subdomains thereof and any other websites or webpages we own or operate that include a link to this policy (all of which together are referred to as the “Sites”). Please keep in mind that this Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites, which may be accessible from the Sites. External websites may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from those contained here.

Because many of the visitors to the site are children, we recognize the need for additional privacy protection for children on our Sites. We adhere to the United States Children Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and encourage all younger visitors to check with parents or guardians before entering information on any website, including ours. See additional information on our Children Privacy Policies below.

 We may additionally use "cookies" on our site. Essentially a cookie is data that the computer that hosts our Sites gives to your browser when you access the Sites. For example cookies are useful for you since our Sites may set a cookie on your browser when you sign in so that in the future you don’t need to input your username and password each time you visit our Sites. Nevertheless we do not use cookies to collect Personal Data except when you’ve given us your permission. You can always remove your cookies or turn them off.

 We use your Personal Information in order to administer the Sites and allow you to use and participate in the Service.  For example, we use your Personal Information to:

 We will communicate with you only if you want us to.   

4. With whom do we share your personal information

 We do not share your Personal Information with third parties unless you specifically authorize us to do so or if required by law.  For example:
 * if you choose to share your courses and playlists, we will share their contents with the pool of recipients you select
 * if you choose to share your courses and playlists, we will identify you as the author of the applicable resource
 * we may share your Personal Information as necessary to comply with a court order or other legal process or as necessary to enforce our Terms of Use 

 In the event of our sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, or transfer of substantial assets, we may share your Personal Information only to the extent required for our successor in interest to continue to provide the Service and operate the Sites, as subject to this Privacy Policy.

5. Children’s Privacy Policies

 The Service is in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).  Parental or guardian consent is required for the collection, use or disclosure of information from children under 13.  If consent is not provided by or on behalf of a parent or guardian within a reasonable time, we will not collect, use or disclose any Personal Information from the child.  Children must obtain parental consent in order to register for and use the Service.  During the sign-up process, we will require any minor to provide a parent’s or guardian’s email address for verification of such parent or guardian’s consent to the Terms of Use and authorization for their child to use the Service.  If your child has used the Sites and submitted Personal Information to us without consent, please contact us and we will immediately remove that information from the Sites and our database.

 Here is how you can provide us with parental or guardian consent for your child’s use of the Service:
 * when a child registers for the Service, the Service will require a parent’s or legal guardian’s email address
 * the Service will generate an email to the entered address with a link to a landing page which will allow the parent or guardian, after being authenticated, to (1) be notified of this Privacy Policy, (2) choose to provide consent for the collection, use and disclosure of their child’s Personal Information, and (3) authorize the child’s use of the Service.  
 * Once the parent or legal guardian consents, the Service will send a confirmatory stating our receipt of the consent.  

 Other notable points on our children’s privacy practices:	
 * We do not ask children to share more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity. 
 * Information collected from children will only be retained for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the activity. 

 Please keep in mind that while we take reasonable precautions to safeguard your Personal Information no amount of protection can guarantee its security.  We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information provided via the Sites from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. That being said, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Sites may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to us via the Internet. 

 Your access to and use of the Sites is subject to the Terms of Use at www.opened.io.
