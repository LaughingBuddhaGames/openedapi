OpenEd API
==========

OpenEd is the world's largest educational resource catalog, currently with over 250,000 videos, games and other resources.  It is the only site completely focused on aligning educational resources to standards.   

The OpenEd API lets you use the capabilities of the OpenEd engine for finding resources and providing information about educational standards (Common Core and otherwise) inside your own apps and websites.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the api.opened.io domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.  API calls which make changes require OAuth 2 authentication.

MANAGING RESOURCES
==================

OpenEd allows videos to be searchable with the following REST API, from any app, web or otherwise.


Resource Search
---------------

Find resources based on:

* descriptive - searches title, description, area_title and subject_title with Solr fulltext search
* standard_group_id - looks for resources aligned with specified standards are in the standard_group by standard_group.id
* category - looks for resources aligned with specified standards are in the category by category.id or category.title
* standard - looks for resources aligned with specified standard by standard.id (the internal object ID) or standard.identifier (the Common Core ID)
* area - looks for resources assigned with specified area (and/or with specified subjects of area) by area.id or area.title
* subject - looks for resources assigned with specified subject by subject.id or subject.title
* grade - restricts to specified grades (expressed as K,1, .. 12)
* ids - comma separated list of resource IDs (will ignore all other supplied filters)
* limit - resources to return, default to 50

For example:

` https://api.opened.io/resources.json?descriptive=Fibonacci%20sequence&limit=3 `

will return a JSON object like the following

```json

You should use the share_url attribute as the URL to display to your users.   The underlying resource is safe_url, but it is (ironically) "unsafe" (the underlying resources can move).  If you use share_url OpenEd manages underlying URLs movements.

Resource Show
-------------
Show the specified resource. Provide the resource identifier as the resource ID number followed by ".json".  For example:

` https://api.opened.io/resources/101054.json `

Add Resources to OpenEd
-----------------------
[This call requires OAuth2 authentication]

You can also add resources to the OpenEd catalog, given that you know the URL of where the resource is hosted.  

The add method takes a hash with resource attributes, listed below.  For example it can be invoked as follows:

` https://api.opened.io/resources/add.json `

In the body of the post method the resources hash is provided in JSON form. Each resource in the hash can have the following attributes:
* url - where is the resource hosted - REQUIRED
* title - what do you want to call the resource. It doesn't have to match what you have on your site - REQUIRED
* description - more information about the resource.  You are strongly urged to supply a description as it helps the OpenEd recommendation engine highlight your resirces
* standard_idents - the list of standards aligned to the resource.  You do not have to supply this. OpenEd will attempt to determine alignments once your resource is contributed
* subjects - the list of subjects (from the OpenEd area/subject taxonomy describe below) associated with the resource
* grades_range - in the form "lowgrade-highgrade", e.g. "K-4"
* contribution_name - your site as the contributor so we can give you credit. Defaults to OAuth username. 
* resource_type - Either "video", "game", "assessment", or "other".  Default to "other" if it is not identified as a video
* rating - The rating of the resource on a scale of "1" to "5" if you have one on your site 
* image - An image that acts as a preview of the video. When possible with other resource types thumbnails are encouraged. This is a URL link.

 For example:

```json
    {
      "url": "http://yoursite.com/yourawesomevideo.mp4",
      "title": "My Awesome Counting Video",
      "description": "Vun octopus arm, two octopus arms..three vunderful octopus arms",
      "standard_idents": [
        "K.CC.1",
        "K.CC.4"
      ],
      "grades_range": "K-1",
      "contribution_name": "YourSite",
      "resource_type": "video",
      "rating": "5",
      "image": "http://yoursite.com/pics/awesomevideothumb.jpg"
    }
```

Upload Resource to OpenEd
-------------------------
[This call requires OAuth2 authentication]

This uploads the actual resource binary itself to OpenEd.  We use YouTube to host videos.  We have our own server space for other resources.

MANAGING STANDARDS
==================

OpenEd also allows you to search for information on standards themselves (in addition to finding resources for standards).  Standards are organized into "standard groups" such as "Common Core Math" and "Common Core Language Arts".  Within a standard group there are "grade groups" such as "Elementary" and "Middle School".  Each grade group has a set of "categories" (sometimes known as "strands"), such as "Geometry". Within categories there are individual standards. This method of organizing standards was created by the Common Core State Standards, but we use it to structure all standard groups.  



Standard Groups
---------------
List all standard groups along with resource counts.  

For example:
` http://api.opened.io/standard_groups.json `

will return the full list below:

```json
{
  "standard_groups": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Common Core Language Arts",
      "title": "Common Core Language Arts",
      "count": 3844
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "name": "Common Core Literacy:History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects",
      "title": "Common Core Literacy:History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects",
      "count": 206
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Common Core Math",
      "title": "Common Core Math",
      "count": 9072
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "name": "National Geography Standards",
      "title": "National Geography Standards",
      "count": 78
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "New York Common Core Social Studies",
      "title": "New York Common Core Social Studies",
      "count": 880
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "name": "Next Generation Science Standards",
      "title": "Next Generation Science Standards",
      "count": 603
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Social Studies (California History Standards)",
      "title": "Social Studies (California History Standards)",
      "count": 984
    }
  ]
}
```

Grade Groups
------------
You can also list the grade groups that are available in a given standard group. It will the grade group along with the grades corresponding to that group.  

For example:

` http://api.opened.io/grade_groups.json?standard_group=Common%20Core%20Math `

will return the full list below:

```json
{
  "grade_groups": [
    {

        "updated_at": "2013-10-11T17:57:04Z"
      }
    },
    {

        "updated_at": "2012-12-09T17:15:29Z"
      }
    },
    {

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Categories
----------
You can list the categories (also known as "strands") based on several criteria. It will also return a count of resources.  
* standard_group - shows all categories within a standard group
* grade_group - restricts the categories to those associated with a specific grade group, such as Elementary (coming soon)
* grade - restricts the categories to those associated with specific grade groups that have that grade (coming soon)

For example:

` http://api.opened.io/categories.json?standard_group=Common%20Core%20Math `

will return these categories (artificially limited to first six):

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": 424,
      "title": "A Child\u2019s Place in Time and Space",
      "grade_group": "Elementary",
      "count": 46
    },
    {
      "id": 489,
      "title": "Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity (K-5)",
      "grade_group": "Elementary",
      "count": 37
    },
    {
      "id": 427,
      "title": "California: A Changing State",
      "grade_group": "Elementary",
      "count": 54
    },
    {
      "id": 470,
      "title": "Civic Ideals and Practices",
      "grade_group": "Elementary",
      "count": 72
    },
    {
      "id": 426,
      "title": "Continuity and Change - Cultural Landscape of California, American Indians, and Impact of New Immigrants",
      "grade_group": "Elementary",
      "count": 55
    },
    {
      "id": 260,
      "title": "Counting and Cardinality",
      "grade_group": "Elementary",
      "count": 231
    }
  ]
}
```

Standards
---------

Get the list of standards with number of aligned resources based on parameters:

* category - just the standards for a given standard category
* standard_group_id - just the standards for a given standard group
* grade_group - just the standards for a given grade group (generally combined with standard group, since the category is already within a grade group)
* grade - just the standards relevant to a given grade (K-12), generally combined with standard group or category

For example: 

` https://api.opened.io/standards.json?category=260 `

returns: 

```json

AREA/SUBJECT TAXONOMY
=====================
OpenEd categorizes all resources in an area/subject taxonomy.  The top level is areas such as Math and Language Arts.  The next level is subject such as Geometry or Writing.

Areas List
----------
Areas with number of assigned resources for area and/or for subjects in area. For example: 

` https://api.opened.io/areas.json `

returns the following areas:

```json
{
  "areas": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Mathematics",
      "count": 7460
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Language Arts",
      "count": 3929
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "title": "Social Studies",
      "count": 1172
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "title": "Science",
      "count": 837
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "title": "Other",
      "count": 32
    }
  ]
}
```

Subjects List
-------------
Get the list of subjects with number of assigned resources based on parameters:
* area - just the subjects for a given area 

For example:
` https://api.opened.io/subjects.json?area=1 `

returns:

```json
{
  "subjects": [
    {
      "id": 6,
      "title": "Measurement & Data",
      "count": 1041
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Geometry",
      "count": 1277
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "title": "Trigonometry",
      "count": 84
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "title": "Statistics and Probability",
      "count": 583
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Algebra",
      "count": 2039
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "title": "Number Sense and Operations",
      "count": 3013
    }
  ]
}
```


OAUTH2 FOR CATALOG UPDATES
==========================

Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow
----------------------------------------

See for details http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3
You can use the one of Client Libraries http://oauth.net/2/

Or you can try to add something using cURL

Call to get access token

` curl -X POST -d "client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&amp;client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]&amp;grant_type=password&amp;username=[USERNAME]&amp;password=[PASSWORD]" [API_ENDPOINT]/oauth/token `

returns:

```json
{
  "access_token": "[TOKEN]",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "expires_in":7200,
  "refresh_token": "[REFRESH_TOKEN]"
}
```

Now you can add resources to catalog using access_token like this:

` curl -X POST --header "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" -d "url=http://example123.com/&amp;title=Test\ title" [API_ENDPOINT]/resources/add.json `

if resource was added it will returns:

```json
{
  "notice": "Resource was added successfully",
  "id": 1
}
```
